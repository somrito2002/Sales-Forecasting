PYTHON WITH DATA SCIENCE: Sales Forecasting for Retail Businesses Using Time Series Analysis

PROJECT OVERVIEW :
This project aims to predict future sales for retail businesses using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical sales data, businesses can make informed decisions on inventory management, demand forecasting, and financial planning. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing data science methodologies and the fbprophet model for accurate predictions.

FEATURES :
Time series forecasting using the fbprophet model.
Sales trend visualization with plot_plotly.
Performance evaluation using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
Interactive visualizations for insights.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, fbprophet, sklearn
Machine Learning Model: Facebook Prophet (fbprophet)
Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

USAGE :
Load the dataset containing historical sales data.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, format dates, etc.).
Train the fbprophet model on the dataset.
Generate sales forecasts for future periods.
Visualize the predictions using plot_plotly.
Evaluate the model's performance using RMSE.

RESULTS :
Sales forecasts are generated with high accuracy.
Visualizations help businesses understand trends and seasonality.
The model evaluation ensures reliability before deployment.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT :
Implementing other time series models for comparison.
Adding external factors like promotions, holidays, and weather data.
Deploying the model as a web-based dashboard for real-time insights.

CONCLUSION :
This project provides a robust and scalable approach to sales forecasting using time series analysis. By leveraging the fbprophet model, businesses can enhance decision-making and optimize resource allocation.
